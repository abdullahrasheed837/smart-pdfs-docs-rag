## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with these backend endpoints:

- `POST /ingest/file` - Upload documents
- `POST /query` - Ask questions (with streaming)
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Customization

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Styling

The app uses modern CSS with:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- CSS Variables for theming
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
